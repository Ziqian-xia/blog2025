I jot down the reminders that shape how I work and learn from mentorship sessions.

> “Always knowing your variable before you do analysis.”
>
> “Do not worry about senior, just do good work.”
>
> “Do what you good at, do what you love.”

— Jon Krosnick

More notes to come as the mentorship continues.
